This was a nice thought, but I ran out of steam quite a while ago.  I'm not sure there's a point to this sort of tooling when we have libraries for languanges like Python which can glue together whatever this project would have done.

Simple SDS
==========

The Simple SDS project provides tools to inspect [NetCDF 3/4](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), [HDF4](http://www.hdfgroup.org/)) (and eventually HDF5) scientific data files.  These tools are built on top of a library that provides a uniform interface to the supported file formats.

Component Status
----------------

library: NetCDF3/4 working, HDF4 working, HDF5 not yet
sds-dump: works.
nc2code: might barely work; not fully functional and needs reworking.
